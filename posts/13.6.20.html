			<h1>13.6.20</h1>

			<h2>1.00</h2>

			<p>This hasn’t been a good year, it just hasn’t.</p>

			<p>Many things have happened, but the worst of all of them is the COVID-19 pandemic and the complete lockdown of society. This of course meant that my college classes had to go online. This wasn’t an issue at first, but it slowly became one. The first consequence of this situation was that now I had no reason to stay in Bogotá, I had to quickly pack my things and catch a flight to Cali, to my parents’s apartment. </p>

			<p>I don’t really know Cali. I have never stayed in Cali for more than just a couple of days. This means that my high school friends, though most of them study in Cali, were in lockdown with their families back in Tuluá. </p>

			<h2>15.30</h2>

			<p>It is frankly amazing how my family can find new and innovative way to antagonize me and turn all their energies into making me the enemy. I’ve tried to don’t give them so much credit with this, but it’s become harder and harder not to think they’re doing all of this in purpose. </p>

			<p>They never fail to create trouble were there is none, and always it seems to be my sole fault. I just can’t ignore this pattern of consistency to picture me as the creator of their disgraces; and their persistence to put my sister in a golden shrine, incapable of doing harm, and only attack me even if I’m reacting to her open and direct aggressions against me. </p>

			<p>This can only lead me to the conclusion that it is clearly a collective effort, they know exactly what they are doing and they are constantly trying to harm me in as many (psychological and philosophical) ways as they possible can.</p>

			<h3>Vergiss nie, was sie getan haben</h3>

			<p>A while ago I wrote in a sheet of paper the words “Vergiss nie, was sie get haben”. I didn’t mean all of them back then, but deep down I think I actually did mean all of them. Since then, those words have become some sort of mantra, or even a kind of prophetic prediction; they always come back again and again through the months reminding me of their actions. </p>

			<p>I’m not a revengeful person. Partly because I forget the feelings and specifics of people’s actions, and partly because I don’t like conflict. So I always forgive and try to keep things the way they are. Of course, this is why I’m always screwed with by others many times. I just don’t learn my lesson. It is in these moments when those words come back to me. It is my past self’s way of telling me “I told you so” and still haven’t learnt how to properly listen. But this has to change, I need to finally and definitely remember what they have done.</p>
